# SemaphoreSlimExample
An example of using Semaphore Slim in requesting data from websites. 

It is usual situation that we need to access the websites or APIs that have a certain limitation in number of simultaneous calls 
we can make to them in order to access the data.

We can specify this number using SemaphoreSlim which limits the number of threads that can access a resource or pool of resources concurrently.
